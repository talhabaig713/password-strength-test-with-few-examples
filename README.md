# password-strength-test-with-few-examples
Understanding what makes passwords strong and weak and improve the strength using few rules 
# lets use some examples of passwords to check their strengths:
# 1.abcd12345
*Here there is an example of an simple password which is really easy to guss and surprisingly commonly used in most devices that are used very rarely or only has specific users

# 2.kayle1234
In this example shows many uses their the name with few numbers that is easy to remember and guss for their own devices

# 3.KaylE*123
This is an example were the user can remember easily can can be little harder to guss so many website accepte such passwords.

# 4.JacoB):123
The only down side with this password is the 123 consicutive numbers which can be gussed imediately.

# 5.DoSs1&493
This is the perfect example of a secure password were all the rules are followed and is harder to guss and cannot be easily cracked using brutefore attack

# Some of the rules followed to get a strong passwords:
Password meters typically reward the following attributes, which make a password more difficult to guess:

   # Length:
   A longer password is considered stronger. Modern standards, like those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), prioritize length over complexity.
   # Character diversity:
   Using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols increases the number of possible combinations. The meter awards points for each character type included.
   # Randomness:
   Points are awarded for unpredictability. This includes using characters and sequences that do not follow common patterns.
   # Unique words (for passphrases):
   When a passphrase (e.g., CorrectBatteryStapleHorse) is used, the meter checks for the inclusion of random, unrelated words to increase strength.

# Weaknesses that decrease password strength
Meters penalize passwords that contain patterns or data easily exploited by attackers. These include:

   # Common passwords:
   Passwords found in leaked databases or on "most common password" lists (e.g., 123456, password, qwerty) are flagged as weak.
   # Dictionary words: 
   The meter checks against dictionary attacks by reducing the score for passwords containing words from any language.
   # Personal information:
   The meter checks for usernames, names, birthdays, and other personal data that can be easily found via social engineering.
   # Sequential or repeated characters:
   Penalties are applied for sequences like 123456 or asdfgh and for repeated characters like aaaaaa.
   # Predictable patterns:
   Simple complexity patterns, such as capitalizing the first letter and adding a number at the end (Password1!), are recognized and penalized as weak, since attackers can easily predict and crack them.
